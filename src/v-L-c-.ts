var meraNAME = "Ali Arain";

meraNAME = "Ali Imtiaz"; //reassign

var meraNAME = "Ali" //redeclare
console.log("My name is " + meraNAME);

// we abviously confuse in these patterens that what we do now and what we done 

let myNAME = "Muneeb";

myNAME = "Musa"; //ressign

// let myNAME = "Musa"; can't redeclare again 

console.log("My bhai son name is " + myNAME);

// this is easir way to understand what we done in past 

const fatherName = "Imtiaz Ahmed";

// fatherName = "Imtiaz"; can't ressign the value

// const fatherName ="Ahmed"; can't redeclare the value

console.log("My father name is " + fatherName);

// this helps us to know what are the permenent things in our program
